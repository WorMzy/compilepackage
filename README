A script to make compiling packages easier on Arch Linux

Prerequisites:

- You must have the following installed:
 - Arch Linux (duh)
 - asp (for retrieval of ABS PKGBUILDS)
 - cower (for retrieval of AUR PKGBUILDS)
 - devtools (for making and maintaining a clean chroot)
 - curl (you should have this installed anyway, it's a dependency of pacman)
 - sudo (for running devtools scripts, and installing packages -- asuming you're not running the scrpt as root)

- You may need the following installed:
 - zsh (you're very welcome to replace the shebang with whatever shell you want, I can't guarantee that the script will still work as expected though)


Normal usage:

1. Put the script, the functions directory, and the symlink (if you want to compile multilib packages) into ~/.scripts
2. In a shell (preferably zsh), run:
     . ~/.scripts/compilepackage packagename
     (replacing packagename with the name of the package)
3. If the PKGBUILD makes multiple packages, or the installation gets interrupted somehow, the following variables are available to help with the installation process:
     $_pkg : package name - if the PKGBUILD makes a single package, this will be the full filename of that package. e.g. "linux-3.3.4-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz"
     $_ver : version - this is everything after "$pkgname-", e.g. "3.3.4-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz"
      $all : all filenames - if the PKGBUILD makes multiple packages, this is an array which contains the full filenames of each package created. e.g. ['linux-3.3.4-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz' 'linux-headers-3.3.4-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz']

Extended usage:
  The script currently has two switches:
  -s   Sync sources from git repos. This option makes the script download files from the Arch repos, rather than the ABS mirror (which only syncs the git repos once a day). This option is slow, and should be used sparingly. It will fail if the package is an AUR package. (May no longer be needed since asp is now being used)
  -n   No source download. Makes the script skip downloading the PKGBUILD and related source files, speeding up the rebuilding of a recently built package, or a -git package.
